  Hi, I am Igor Peschinskiy, a software engineer at Yandex since 2019, focusing on backend development, data processing and infrastructure support.
  My main areas of interest in tech are C++, functional programming, performance optimizations and GIS.
  </p>

  <p>
  I work at Yandex Maps, the largest cartography service in Russia with millions of daily users.
  Before Yandex I was developing control systems for power stations, combining system programming and GUI development.
  I studied embedded programming at university, and early in my career I built microcontroller and ASIC-based systems.
  While I don't claim to be an expert in all of these fields, I believe that my experience in a wide range of technologies will help me to find underexplored topics for writing.
  </p>

  <p>
  The goal of this blog is not to share subjective opinions or write tutorials.
  Instead, I aim to explore synergies and interconnections between technologies, focusing on real-world examples and the benefits of developing software at the intersection of different domains.
