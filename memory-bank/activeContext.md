# Active Context

## Current Focus
The primary focus has been implementing the core Jekyll blog structure with GitHub Pages. This includes:

- Configured Jekyll for GitHub Pages

## Active Decisions

### Content Strategy
- Implemented sample posts demonstrating technical writing style
- Using excerpt separator (<!--more-->) to display first paragraph on the main page
- Categories and tags structure established in sample posts

### Design Implementations
- Minimalist design with dark header and light content area
- Mobile-first responsive design with breakpoints for different devices
- Fira Code as monospace font for code blocks
- Clean typography focusing on readability

### Technical Implementations
- GitHub Pages gem for Jekyll compatibility
- SEO and feed plugins activated
- Static CSS approach rather than complex SASS structure for simplicity
- Local development environment configured

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. Add favicon for the site
2. Create additional blog posts
3. Enhance meta tags for better SEO
4. Consider implementing categories/tags pages
5. Add syntax highlighting theme for code blocks

### Upcoming Work
1. Set up GitHub Actions for automated builds
2. Add image optimization workflow
3. Consider implementing dark mode
4. Add analytics if determined necessary
5. Test across more browsers and devices

## Open Questions
- Should commenting functionality be added, or keep the site static-only?
- Is analytics integration necessary for the initial launch?
- Should pagination be implemented as post count grows?
- What SEO improvements would bring the most value?
